Interview Spark is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline the initial stages of the hiring process. It automatically screens and rates candidates by analyzing their resumes against a specific job description, helping recruiters and hiring managers quickly identify the most suitable applicants.

## Key Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages the Google Gemini API to perform a deep, contextual analysis of resumes, going beyond simple keyword matching.
- **üìÑ Bulk Resume Upload**: Upload multiple candidate resumes at once with a simple and intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Supported formats include `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, and more.
- **üéØ Job Description Matching**: Paste any job description, and the AI will use it as the single source of truth for its analysis.
- **üìà Detailed Scoring & Feedback**: Each candidate receives a quantitative **Suitability Score** (from 1 to 10), a qualitative summary, and a clear list of **Pros** and **Cons**.
- **‚≠ê Top Candidate Identification**: The system automatically highlights the best-fit candidate based on the overall analysis, saving you time and effort.
- **‚ú® Modern & Clean UI**: A responsive, easy-to-use interface built with React and Tailwind CSS provides a seamless user experience.

## How to Use

Using Interview Spark is a simple three-step process:

1.  **Paste the Job Description**: In the first section, paste the complete job description for the role you are hiring for. The more detail you provide, the more accurate the AI's analysis will be.

2.  **Upload Resumes**: Drag and drop one or more resume files into the uploader, or click to select them from your computer. You will see a list of "Staged Files" ready for analysis.

3.  **Analyze**: Click the **"Analyze Resumes"** button. The AI will process each resume against the job description. This may take a few moments.

4.  **Review Results**: Once the analysis is complete, the results will appear. You can review each candidate's score, summary, pros, and cons. The top candidate will be highlighted with a "Top Pick" badge.

## Project Setup

This application is designed to run in a web-based development environment where the necessary dependencies are managed.

### API Key Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key must be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

-   `process.env.API_KEY`: Your secret Google Gemini API key.

The application is architected to read this key directly from the execution environment. No in-app configuration is required.

### File Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories and files:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # Reusable React components (Header, ResultsDisplay, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Contains the geminiService.ts for API interactions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx          # Main application component and state management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx        # Entry point for the React application
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts         # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html           # Main HTML file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # You are here!
```

## API Key Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

For local development, this key must be provided in a `.env` file at the root of the project. See the "Running Locally" section for setup instructions.

For deployment, the key must be available as an environment variable in the execution environment (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY` for a Vite build or a similarly named variable for other platforms).
